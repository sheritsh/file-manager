# File Manager

A command-line file manager built with Node.js (v22.14+), supporting navigation, file operations, OS info, hashing, and compressionâ€”all using only Node.js built-in modules.

## Features

- CLI navigation (`cd`, `up`, `ls`)
- File operations (`cat`, `add`, `mkdir`, `rn`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`)
- OS info (`os --EOL`, `os --cpus`, `os --homedir`, `os --username`, `os --architecture`)
- Hash calculation (`hash`)
- Compression/decompression with Brotli (`compress`, `decompress`)
- Beautiful, table-formatted output for `ls`
- No external dependencies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.14.0 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd file-manager
   ```

2. Install dependencies (none required, but run to create `node_modules` if needed):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

Start the file manager with your username:

```sh
npm run start -- --username=your_username
```

You'll see:

```
Welcome to the File Manager, your_username!
You are currently in /your/home/directory
```
